    <h6>A Doll’s House - Ibsen</h6>
    <p>
        NORA.
        Your skylark would chirp about in every room, with her song rising and falling—

        HELMER.
        Well, my skylark does that anyhow.

        NORA.
        I would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight, Torvald.

        HELMER.
        Nora—you surely don’t mean that request you made to me this morning?

        NORA.
        _[going near him]_. Yes, Torvald, I beg you so earnestly—

        HELMER.
        Have you really the courage to open up that question again?

        NORA.
        Yes, dear, you must do as I ask; you must let Krogstad keep his post in the bank.

        HELMER.
        My dear Nora, it is his post that I have arranged Mrs Linde shall have.

        NORA.
        Yes, you have been awfully kind about that; but you could just as well dismiss some other clerk instead of Krogstad.

        HELMER.
        This is simply incredible obstinacy! Because you chose to give him a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him, I am expected to—

        NORA.
        That isn’t the reason, Torvald. It is for your own sake. This fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers; you have told me so yourself.
        He can do you an unspeakable amount of harm. I am frightened to death of him—

        HELMER.
        Ah, I understand; it is recollections of the past that scare you.

        NORA.
        What do you mean?

        HELMER.
        Naturally you are thinking of your father.

        NORA.
        Yes—yes, of course. Just recall to your mind what these malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly they slandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if the Department had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had not been so kindly disposed and helpful to him.

        HELMER.
        My little Nora, there is an important difference between your father and me. Your father’s reputation as a public official was not above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will continue to be so, as long as I hold my office.</p>
